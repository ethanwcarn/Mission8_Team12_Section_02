@*
    _ViewImports.cshtml – Global View Imports
    This file makes namespaces and Tag Helpers available to all Razor views
    so they don't need to be imported individually in each .cshtml file.
*@

@* Import the main application namespace so views can reference app-level classes *@
@using Mission8

@* Import the Models namespace so views can use Task, Category, etc. without full qualification *@
@using Mission8.Models

@* Enable ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers (asp-for, asp-action, asp-controller, etc.)
   throughout all views. Tag Helpers provide server-side HTML generation
   that works naturally with HTML syntax. *@
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
