    _ViewStart.cshtml – Global View Configuration
    This file runs before every Razor view is rendered.
    It sets the default layout to "_Layout.cshtml" (in Views/Shared),
    so every page automatically inherits the shared header, navbar, and footer
    without needing to specify the layout in each individual view.

    Layout = "_Layout";
