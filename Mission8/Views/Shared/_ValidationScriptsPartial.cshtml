    Shared/_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml – Client-Side Validation Scripts
    Loads jQuery Validation and the unobtrusive validation adapter so that
    form validation (e.g., required fields, range checks) runs in the browser
    before the form is submitted to the server. This provides instant feedback
    to users without a full page reload.
    Views that contain forms can include this partial in their Scripts section.
